		<p class="paragraph">Ever since I started learning piano at the age of 6, It's been a very big part of my life and is one of my go-to hobbies. 
			Playing the piano helps me rewind when I'm stressed, and it's also a great way to express your creativity using music. 
			After finally completing my Level 10 piano practical exam back in the summer, I can't help but feel accomplished at the fact that all my hard work has finally paid off!
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Here are some benefits to playing the piano and why you should try it:</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			-It helps relieve stress
			<br>
			-It improves your multitasking skills and concentration skills
			<br>
			-It stimulates the brain and primes it for other forms of communication
			<br>
			-It improves dexterity and hand-eye coordination
			<br>
			-It can improve your overall aural awareness
			<br>
			-And many more...!
			<br>
			<br>
			Playing the piano has many benefits, which is why I strongly encourage you to try it if you haven't already!
